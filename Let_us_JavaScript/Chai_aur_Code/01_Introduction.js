Q2:- JS is dynamically type language or statically?
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In dynamically typed languages like JavaScript, the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, and a variable can be assigned values of different types during the execution of the program. This is in contrast to statically typed languages where the data type of a variable is explicitly declared and enforced at compile-time.
